About Me

I have some programming experience. For 2.5 years I worked as a full-stack developer, where I gained a lot of experience and knowledge from
different programming concepts, because I was obligated to solve many different types of tasks. Before full-stack position, I participated
in several projects where I worked as html/css developer and did a little bit on testing.
I’m a systematic person and can pay attention to details. I’m pretty good at visualizing complex processes and finding solutions for solving them.
